 communication concerns. 
Also you may wait a little while opening the json file because it is too big. There is 530000 item in there.There was like 2k comments for company
In pycharm you will see a copy of 2.56 not the whole document do not panic and it will not be json because of the preview mode if you 
try to test it.But the whole 180 MB document is json file. Update method is ready to go just run the schedule function.
You do not need to run Spider system and comment getter system they already did their work.
Just use the scheduler and run the scheduler method. It will automatically call update method every hour.
